# tumor_segmentation

This is a repository which we use to develope our semantic segmentation of the whole slide images. The challenge from which we downloaded the data is [CAMELYON16 Contest](https://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/). You can find the link to data (WSIs) from their website. [This](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzsdkU4jWx9Bb19WNndQTlUwb2M) is a direct link to the 2016 dataset on google drive. Use gdrive to automatically download all of them (use shell script).
